TODO:

(General)
-> Make it where it can be sent multiple html files and it renders an output for all of them (can have it loop after flag 
	'-h' or '-c' until it runs into another flag or end of arg. Getting all file names until then)
-> Eventually make a GUI that allows you to upload html files and it sends it to this program and then displays the output png in the gui? 
	(should this be a separate program? maybe just leave this to the epub file reader)


(Style)

-> Get text size to work properly (make it where is can be set with css)
-> Get font family to work properly?
